# 🐓 Project Bantam 

Project Bantam is a compiler for Bantam-Java, a subset of Java 1.8. Project Bantam consists of two main components:
      
    1. A file editor / IDE that can be used to manage Bantam
    programs (.btm suffix)

    2. A compiler that transpiles Bantam files into an
    Abstract Syntax Tree, which can be translated into
    Java code which can be compiled and run on the JVM.
    
# 📝 File Editor and IDE

        Project Bantam contains a rudimentary file editor, capable of creating new files,
    reading, writing, and saving. Like any good file editor, it contains good save-checking. 




# ⚙️ Compiler 

Project Bantam was created as a semester-long project for Dale Skriens CS 361
course at Colby College.

    This project works as the "front-end" of a compiler, with a lexer, parser, and semantic analyzer.
