# Project Bantam, Version 1.10

A compiler for an object-oriented programming language Bantam, which is a subset of Java.

This repository contains a Bantam-Java IDE, which will transpile Bantam java files into real Java files, which can be run by the Java JVM. Bantam files have the suffix .btm, and contain core features like for loops, while loops, but does not include static functions and other more complex aspects of Java.

This project works as the "front-end" of a compiler, with a lexer, parser, and semantic analyzer. Learn more about compilers here: https://iq.opengenus.org/building-compiler-front-end/

This project was developed for Colby's CS 361 class, taught by Professor Dale Skrien

Contributors include Jasper Loverude, Dylan Tymkiw, and Cassidy Correll
